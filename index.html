                <h2>Treating the Whole Person</h2>

                <p>In many ways homeopathic treatment is similar to counselling or psychotherapy. Much time is spent with the client talking about their problems and how they feel about them. Perhaps the most important aspect of taking the case is being able to truly understand the person seeking my help. Homeopathy treats the whole person, not just the symptoms of disease. It is crucial to develop an understanding of how the client’s problem affects them as a whole person before a curative remedy can be prescribed.</p>

                <!-- <p>My interest in holistic medicine began in 2001 when I began to look beyond mainstream science and explore other philosophical ideas. This interest developed into a fascination with the relationship between the mind and body and the role our thoughts & emotions play in maintaining or disrupting our health and general sense of wellbeing. My approach to healing is to treat the whole person, not just the symptoms of their illness. I seek to help my clients resolve blocks on the mental and emotional level which makes energy available for healing on a physical level. I use Homeopathy to facilitate this process.</p>

                <p>In many ways homeopathic treatment is similar to counselling or psychotherapy. Much time is spent with the client talking about their problems and how they feel about them. The application of the correct remedy(s) however can make the healing process much easier. The client is less likely to get stuck and dwell upon their issues, more likely to resolve them and move forward with their lives. Often the healing effects of homeopathy can be profound, especially on an emotional level.</p>

                <p>Perhaps the most important aspect of taking the case is being able to truly understand the person seeking my help. Homeopathy treats the whole person, not just the symptoms of disease. It is crucial that I have an understanding of how the client’s problem affects them as a whole person before I can prescribe a curative remedy. Therefore I ask the client a broad range of questions which can include any of the following:</p>

                <p>Homeopathy works primarily at the emotional level, helping to heal fixed patterns of feeling, thought and behaviour. How we feel about ourselves and the world around us, greatly affects our emotional and physical wellbeing. </p> -->
