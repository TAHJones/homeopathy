                <h2>Healing with Homeopathy</h2>
                <p>Homeopathy is a safe, effective and natural form of holistic medicine. It works gently and safely to raise the vitality and wellbeing of the whole person, bringing balance and harmony to the emotions, mind and physical body. Homeopathy works primarily at the emotional level, helping to heal fixed patterns of feeling, thought and behaviour. How we feel about ourselves and the world around us, greatly affects our emotional and physical wellbeing. Over time habitual negative emotional states such as anger, anxiety, depression, grief, sadness, stress and shame take their toll on the body, eventually manifesting as physical illness. The application of the correct homeopathic remedy can help resolve the fixed negative emotions that people get stuck in. Homeopathic treatment gives the client the opportunity to move forward and experience greater levels of vitality and emotional and physical wellbeing.</p>
